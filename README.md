---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** 
- **Sample Ecommerce Database** created manually using SQL

## 🗃️ Dataset Schema

We created a sample ecommerce database with the following tables:

1. `customers` – customer info  
2. `products` – product catalog  
3. `orders` – order summary  
4. `order_items` – items in each order  

Each table was populated with mock data for testing and analysis.
